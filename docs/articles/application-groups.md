# Application groups

## What is an application group?
 Marathon keeps all its [services](services.md) in a tree-like structure called application group. Let's consider a few existing services e.g. `/frontend`, `/backend/mysql`, `/backend/cache` and `/backend/service`. The resulting application group will look like following:

```
/frontend
/backend
   /cache
   /mysql
   /service
```
where e.g. `/frontend` exists in the tree root `/` (also refered as "root group") while e.g. `/cache` is an service in the group `/backend`. Note that while `/frontend` is an actual service (with existing service definition), `/backend` is merely a group holding its child applications together. Services and groups may not share names; in this example, you could not also have a service named `/backend`.

Current application groups can be fetched using the Rest API [v2/groups](api.md) endpoint. For the above example, the result would look something like:

```
{
    "id": "/",
    "dependencies": [],
    "apps": [
        {
            "id": "/frontend",
            ...
        }
    ],
    "pods": [],
    "groups": [
        {
            "id": "/backend",
            "dependencies": [],
            "apps": [
                {
                    "id": "/backend/cache",
                    ...
                },
                {
                    "id": "/backend/mysql",
                    ...
                },
                {
                    "id": "/backend/service",
                    ...
                }
            ],
            "groups": [],
            "pods": []
        }
    ]
}
```

This is a JSON representation of the application group tree (the example omits service definition details for brevity). Note that [apps](apps.md) and [pods](pods.md) are held separately (mostly for historic reasons). There is also a `dependencies` field which is explained below.

## How can I use service groups?

Similar to how folders can be used to group related files together, service groups can be used to group similar services. In a bigger organization, where a production cluster is shared between different departments, a structure can looks something like `/$department/$project/$service-group$/$service` (e.g. `/engineering/shop/backend/database`). The advantages of the service groups go beyond simple grouping:

- Group deployment: a service group (and all its recursive children) can be deployed and removed together using one API request. For more information on this topic, see [deployments](deployments.md).
- All services within the group can by [scaled](scaling.md) up or down by some factor (see below).
- Groups can have dependencies on each other (see below).

### Group dependencies

Let's assume that we have a a backend service that needs a database to start. This can be modelled by putting database and backend services in two different groups and defining dependencies between those two:

```
/product
   /database
     /mysql
     /mongo
   /service
     /rails-app
     /play-app

```

All services can be deployed by POSTing a group definition to `/v2/groups` REST API endpoint (concrete service definitions are omitted from this example):

```
{
  "id": "/product",
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "/product/database",
      "apps": [
         { "id": "/product/database/mongo",
            ...
         },
         { "id": "/product/database/mysql",
            ...
         }
       ]
    },{
      "id": "/product/service",
      "dependencies": ["/product/database"],
      "apps": [
         { "id": "/product/service/rails-app",
            ...
         },
         { "id": "/product/service/play-app",
            ...
         }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that `/product/service` group has a defined dependency on `/product/database`. This means that Marathon will deploy all services in the `/product/database` group and wait for them to become ready, before proceeding withÂ deploying any services in the group `/product/service`. In this case, ready is defined as all the corresponding tasks are started, and that they are healthy should health checks be defined.

**Note:** Marathon group dependencies are "deployment time dependencies", meaning they are respected only during the initial deployment of the services. Should any of the services fail during their respective life-cycle, they are restarted independent of defined dependecies.

### Group scaling

A group and all of its trasitive services can be scaled up or down by a given factor by POSTing following payload to `/v2/groups/{group}` (e.g. `/v2/groups/product/service`):

```
{
   "scaleBy": 2
}
```

This can come in handy when scaling a group of product services due to e.g. change in traffic.

## IMPORTANT CAVEATS

### Deploying an entire group

When deploying an application group, it will replace **all** existing services for the given path transitively.

For the sake of example, say you have the following existing services:

* `/product/service/rails-app`
* `/product/service/play-app`

If you post the following group definition to the `/v2/groups` REST endpoint, then `/product/service/rails-app` will be removed:

```
{
  "id": "/product/service",
  "dependencies": ["/product/database"],
  "apps": [
    { "id": "/product/service/play-app",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```
