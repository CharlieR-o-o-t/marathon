# Tasks

## Overview

A task is a process which is launched by Mesos executor on the Mesos Agent. When Marathon launches an instance of the service definition, Marathon sends a command to Mesos to launch one or more tasks.

## How can I use a Task?

Tasks are automatically created by Mesos once a service definition is being launched.

There are several other places where interaction with Tasks is possible. This includes:

## API endpoints:

In Marathon, there are several API endpoints related to tasks. To learn more, check out the respective `apps`, `pods` and `tasks` sections on the [Marathon REST API page](http://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/api-console/index.html).

## Marathon Health Checks configuration

`taskKillGracePeriodSeconds` field allows you to set the amount of time between when the executor sends the `SIGTERM` message to gracefully terminate a task and when it kills it by sending `SIGKILL`. Please check the [health checks](health-checks.md) page for more information.

## Unreachable Strategy

There are a parameters to control the Marathon's treatment of unreachable tasks, with regards to how quickly a replacement task is launched, and how quickly Marathon treats the task as permanently gone. See the Unreachable Strategy page for more information.

## Environment Variables

Tasks receive various environment variables, describing networking ports, Mesos metadata, and Marathon metadata. Itâ€™s also possible to specify custom environment variables. See the Environment Variables page for more information.

A more detailed explanation of tasks can be found on [Apache Mesos website](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/).
